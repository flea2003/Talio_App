### Backlog

Hi! Just a note before you read the feedback and start panicking. This feedback is purely constructive (since it's only a draft) and will help you in getting a good grade for the final version of the backlog. Please read it **carefully** and adjust **everything** (or almost everything) I mentioned below. This is standardized feedback, meaning it's based on a clear rubric and I am pointing out all the things you miss from that rubric, thus it may come off as a bit harsh. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them during the TA Meeting. :)

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file is correctly submitted. Also, please rename the final document according to the guidelines on the website ("backlog.pdf").


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Overall, the backlog follows the recommended structure, which is a great thing. The information is clearly formulated and contains a nice description. It's also very good that you created a mock-up for illustrating the application.
However, the basic and advanced features should not be listed like this. Instead, **the epics must be constructed based on them**.


### Epics

Mark: Sufficient (PLEASE ADJUST THIS IN ORDER TO PASS)

Feedback: The backlog should first of all contain an epic for a "minimal app", as stated on the website. Thus, the splitting for the basic requirements is not necessary. For the advanced requirements, please have a look over the introduction slides again and split the epics in (exactly) as presented in the lecture and in the same priority order.
Epics should also have a description that clarify the feature, again as stated on the course website. Make sure to add this.

Based on this new split, you can update the mock-upd/split the mock-ups into smaller mock-ups that showcase these epics in particular, not the whole application.


### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: The user stories mostly follow the required format, have a clear focus on the user perspective. This is great! However, some user stories describe more than one workflow, which can be noticed due to the high amount of acceptance criteria. Also, please do not put ":" after every story. The acceptance criteria should usually be implicit, so expecting some acceptance criteria after every user story is not necessarily okay for a backlog.

Since you have no epic description, I couldn't notice any "gaps" of functionality (parts of the app that are not explained), but this might not be true. Please make sure of this yourself before submitting the final version.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Sufficient (PLEASE ADJUST THIS IN ORDER TO PASS)

Feedback: There are way too many acceptance criteria. This suggests that the acceptance criteria is actually an user story, so make sure to recheck the backlog and split acordingly. In the end, most of the user stories should be small and have a clear effect, and only the (few) overloaded stories need to be disambigued by acceptance criteria.
Regarding clarity, the whole contents of the backlog need to be formulated in a **measurable** way, that allows to decide when a story is done/finished. Thus, go through the backlog one more time and either remove or add more quantifiable descriptions to "uncertain" words like: "easily", "various", etc.
