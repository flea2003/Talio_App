# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

Hi! Please remember that this feedback is only related **to the main branch**. Never forget to merge your development/other branches to main.

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: 
> The repository seems to contain a good amount of commits and they seem to only touch upon a specific piece of functionality. However, please be a more consistent with the naming: no lowercase letters, same verb tense, etc.
> You can check out this website: https://reflectoring.io/meaningful-commit-messages/, which gives some useful tips for structuring your commits (e.g. using imperative instead of past tense).


#### Isolation

Grade: Excellent

Feedback: 
> You seem to have a very good amount of merge requests for this week. In addition, the branches you use are related and successfully isolate individual features.
> I really like that you are using the "Create branch from issue" feature, it makes the whole process more clear and measurable. This is great, keep it up!


#### Reviewability

Grade: Good

Feedback:
> The MRs contain a good amount of commits, with related and coherent changes.
> Regarding the MR construction, most of your MRs have no description/very minimal description. Here is an article that can help you understand the value of merge descriptions (and it also has a template, you can check it out and try to adapt it to the project): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-you-should-write-merge-requests-like-youre-posting-to-instagram-765e32a3ec9c/.


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Good

Feedback:
> You have an okay amount of comments, but try to strive for more. If you are talking about the code on other platforms (Discord, WhatsApp, etc.), it would be great to migrate these discussions directly to Gitlab, so that the code reviews are extensive but not artificial.
> Moreover, please make sure that you have at least 2 approvals for a merge request, at least when the functionality is more important/difficult to implement.


#### Build Server

Grade: Excellent

Feedback: 
> The builds have a reasonable duration and do not fail frequently, which is great!
> Also, good job for adding coherent and reasonable checkstyle rules!
