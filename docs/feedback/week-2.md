## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Rafael
- **Notetaker**: Victor

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Both a chair and a minute taker were selected, which is great. Good job!

Reminder for next meetings: Please remember that it is MANDATORY to rotate roles every week.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was coherent and followed the provided template. The topics were clearly described and showcased your concerns and discussion points for this week.

Reminder for next meetings: Please remember to add this document to the repository prior to every meeting so I can have access to it and check its contents beforehand.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair coordinated the meeting and presented the main points successfully. Also, there was enough time allowed for each of the team members to expose their ideas regarding every topic.

#### Time management

Mark: Excelent

Feedback: The topics were all covered extensively, which is great. I appreciated that you thought about a lot of questions beforehand and that you are comfortable enough to explain what you don't understand/ask for clarifications in a manner that doesn't interrupt the meeting flow.

Reminder for next meetings: I can only give you feedback on the assignments (prior to the deadline) if you REQUEST it yourselves.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes are clear and useful for the team. I also appreciated that, along with fulfilling the notetaking role, the minute taker was also involved in the discussion and presented their ideas/concerns.

Reminder for next meetings: Please keep in mind to upload the notes right after every meeting on the repository and to write them down in the agenda (i.e. the agenda will be uploaded 2 times, one before the meeting with the topics and one after the meeting with the complete notes).

#### Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: As a team, you seem to communicate well and pay attention to each other's ideas. However, it seems like some of the people are more involved in the discussion and more eager to showcase their ideas than others. Please try to balance out the level of communication inside the group (and encourage team members to speak up instead of taking the lead, for example). This will help building your bond as a team.
