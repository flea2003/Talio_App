# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Victor
Minute taker: Aryan

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Please never forget to add all agendas and notes to the repository, in /docs/agendas. It is **mandatory** to have all documents where requested. The agenda itself is very good, it follows the template and is very well detailed for every topic. Great job on the content!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

I added this feedback already in week2-feedback on Gitlab. I will give the feedback on the notes for this meeting in next meeting's feedback, due to this template change.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair successfully coordinated the meeting and presented all topics in a professional manner. I appreciated that enough time was given after asking a question for the teammates to express their ideas. Good job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: I would like to see a bit more initiative and input from each team member. You need to take ownership and coordinate the meeting, so try to be a bit more active. This will ensure a more constructive atmosphere.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Please start coding. From next week onward, you need to present everything you have submitted on the main branch in order to evaluate your progress.
Regarding **process** , research how branches are supposed to work: having a branch for every issue (not one per person), creating a branch from an issue, creating a development branch, etc. Please also learn how to write commits (the verb needs to be in the infinitive form, i.e. "Add a button ...", not "Adding a button ..."). All this information is widely available on the web, so just search up some of these basics and implement them with your team.
Please work with issues and document everything in those issues. Each issue should to contain (at least) 3 parts: Description, Definition of Done based on the backlog/acceptance criteria, Checklist with subtasks for this issue (the subtasks can be implementation specific). You can also search up how to integrate an issue template in Gitlab so you don't need to manually write this template for every issue.
