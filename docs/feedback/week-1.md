## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

I've noticed that, during the Code of Conduct discussion, everybody was involved and tried to showcase their ideas. I also appreciated that you were all receptive and interested both in your team members' professional opinions but also in them as people.
This shows that you are already starting to create a bond as a team based on mutual trust and respect, which is very important throughout the course.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Although you were a bit reticent at first, you managed to successfully moderate the discussion and not be dependent on my input, which helps bulding your team bond.
Regarding the discussion flow, I think that you sometimes get lost in a topic and spend too much time on it, which is not necessarily productive since the meetings are time bounded. Due to this issue, for today's meeting, you did not manage to discuss all suggested topics.
This is fine for now, but, for the next meetings, I suggest you have a more clear view about the topics that need to be covered and assign a timeframe for each of them.
In the teamwork lecture, you will receive more guidelines on how to coordinate and structure your meetings, so pay attention to them in order to improve your meeting productivity :).
