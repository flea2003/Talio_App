# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Aryan
Minute taker: Eirini

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
> The agenda follows the provided template and was added to the repository in time. However, please reformat it to a **markdown** file since it's easier for everybody to read it/add notes to it.

> Each topic is presented clearly and contains a good amount of subtasks, which helps both me and the teammates to understand what the meeting flow is right away.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Previous minute taker: Aryan

Feedback: 
> The notes have been sent on Mattermost, **but not uploaded on Gitlab**. Please upload every single document on Gitlab first and on Mattermost second, this is a hard requirement.

> From a content perspective, the notes contain the concrete agreements and task assignments established during the meeting, which is very important from a progress perspective. The agreements you discussed are realistic and very specific.

> However, some of the notes are not clear and a bit messy. You can try to reformat the notes after the meeting and clean them up so they are more coherent.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback:
> The chair tried to coordonate the meeting as much as possible and to involve everybody. The topics were all covered, which is good.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback:
> Today's meeting was sort of passive on your side. You seem to be scared and unsure as of how to start working on this project.

> I understand your concerns, but try to keep a constructive and positive attitude since it's still quite early in the project and everything can be turned around :).


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
> For the next meetings, please reserve some time to present the current state of your application (i.e. actually have a topic in the agenda related to this).

> Since you are behind track as of today's meeting, it was sort of redundant to do discuss this section in detail, but I hope to see more of your project next time.
