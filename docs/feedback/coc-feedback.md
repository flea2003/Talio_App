# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file is submitted, but not added in the docs folder. Please add it as soon as possible and take into account the submission details provided on the website/in the assignment description from now on.

### General

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Overall, the Code of Conduct contains correct and clearly described information, without unnecessary additions. However, a few parts are not formulated clearly/do not provide the needed amount of detail.

### Assignment Description

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The provided information is correct and detailed enough. Great job!

### Products

Mark: Very good

Feedback: Feedback: This section is very good and well-detailed, but misses the purpose of your application: what are you actually implementing?

### Planning

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The goals and assignments are good and well-structured. However, meeting in person at every submission is quite unrealistic. Instead, you can assign people each week that are responsible for the deliverables. Also, please remember that the agreements you write must REFLECT IN GIT USAGE (e.g. issues with clear descriptions, making use of all milestones/labeling functionality that GitLab provides). 

### Communication

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Very good plan, with the appropiate amount of details. However, it would be great to include Mattermost and what messages/updates/etc. you will send to the TA.


### Commitment

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: It's great that you provided a measure of the work quality. However, there is an unclear sentence "the changing of roles will take place", which is not justified considering you switch roles each week. 


### Division of Tasks and Roles

Mark: Good

Feedback: The explanation is very good, but please provide a schedule of the chairs/minute-takers for every week. For the following weeks, please remember that this schedule should also be reflected in Gitlab (e.g. through issues related to the agenda).

### Meetings
  
Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The meeting planning is very well detailed and realistic, containing exactly how non-TA meetings will be conducted. Great job!

### Decision Making

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The agreements are clear and realistic. You may consider how will you incorporate the TA suggestions/feedback in making a decision.

### Dealing with Conflicts

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: This section lacks detail. For example, you can discuss what to do in case the conflict escaladates and how/when to involve the TA.

### Guidance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The section is realistic, showcasing exactly your expectations. However, it is not very clear what type of the content feedback you want, since it depends whether I am allowed to actually give you that feedback or not. For example, for the assignments, I am allowed to give you feedback if you ask for it, but for the code, I cannot give you any suggestions.

### Consequences
  
Mark: Very good

Feedback: The consequences are good, realistic and well-detailed. However, it may be useful to add more specific situations (e.g. being late to a meeting) and its consequence, along with an "other" scenario that is not covered by these situations.

### Success Factors
  
Mark: Good

Feedback: The success factors are good, but I do not feel like they are a bit too general to particularly fit your team. You can try to find more specific qualities that your team has, based on your personalities, skills and communication levels.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The criteria you have selected are very good. An explanation on WHY these are important to the team will be a great addition to this section.
