# Opening by chair (15:45)
*Check-in* – How is everyone doing?

<br />

# Approval of the agenda (15:46)
- Does anyone have any additions to the agenda?
- Did everyone read the minutes from the previous meeting?

<br />

# Heuristic Usability Evaluation (15:50)
 - # Our Product
    - Is it possible to add images and tables in the required template?
    - Is a short description of our prototype enough or do we need to add it?
    - Are References required?

 - # Minutes
    -	Include images before/after inside  a column
    -	Separate page just for the table if we can’t include it in a column
    -	Table should include the found problems and the frequency
    -	Structure the results in a table (heuristic, issue, weight) or bold the important parts in each problem
    -	Add the prototype by a link( moqups and video)
    -	Citations: only the basic ones are fine

<br />

# Teamwork Self Reflection (16:00)
- Does everyone know about this week's deadlines?
- Is the self reflection an induvidual assignment?
- How is Reflection different than self-evaluation?
- Could we discuss about an example situation?

 - # Minutes
    -	Individual assignment
    -	Not technical stuff but more behavioral
    -	Pass/Fail, not graded
 
<br />

# Product Pitch (16:10)
- Are we supposed to show the actual app in the video or mock-ups?
- Other than showing the funcionality should we talk about the usefulness of each operation and/or something else?
- Is it enough for one person to upload it on Brightspace?

 - # Minutes
    -   Show the actual app
    -   Showcase all basic functionalities
    -   All speak equally
	-   About 10 minutes
	-   Each one should make an appearance 
    -   Mention unique features
    -   Explain how the features help the user
    -	Not too technical but mention some technical stuff
    -	Can make the draft a bit shorter to add more things later
    -	Vital in the evaluation
    -	Don’t show actual code

<br />

# Product Progress (16:16)
- Time to Demonstrate the current state of the App

- # Minutes
    -   Recommended to use @Service in the code
    -   UI is important, spend more time on the design (doesn’t take a lot)
    -	Write tests
    -	Assign weights to issues



<br />

# Feedback (16:25)
