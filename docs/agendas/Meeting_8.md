# Oral evaluation (14:57)

Please note: The oral examination is a pass/fail decision and does not influence the grade. It serves as a measure for fraud prevention and will be used to check individually whether LOs have been reached by asking questions about lecture contents and aspects of the team application. Students that are unable to answer these questions will fail the course, as defined in the individual pass/fail criteria.

- What are LOs?
- Can you walk us throught the process? What kind of questions will there be?
